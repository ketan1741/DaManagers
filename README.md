# Damanagers
Parallax Hack


The application shows and monitors the inflow of dam as authorities are concerned with the same, and this could help them.
Along with that, there will be a specific threshold set for specific dams at which responsible authority will be alerted to take specific actions if possible.
Similar alerting system will be kept in the user application that will give an alarm to user as well.
During the flood like situations, if the danger level crosses 5 there would be an alarm to users 
The app also has the feature to display the safe zones near to the user.
If the water level in the dam reaches the maximum  limit estimated from the model, a notification to the authorities is sent to open the dam gates and the amount of water to be drained out so that it won't flood the nearby areas.
If the dam is filled to its maximum capacity, the amount of rainfall that can lead to breaching of dam and floods is calculated so as to control the dam water inflow and outflow if sudden rainfall reaches the threshold value.
